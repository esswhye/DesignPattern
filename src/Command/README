Command Design pattern is used to decouple Sender and Receiver.
Sender is totally unaware of Receiver's interface and Receiver is unaware of Sender.
Sender and Receiver communicates using command.

Resturant is a classic example of Command Pattern.
Customer(Invoker) is not aware of Chef(Receiver) and they communicate via Waiter(Command Manager) by giving Menu Name(Commands) to them.
Customer doesn't need to know how to communicate directly with Chef.
